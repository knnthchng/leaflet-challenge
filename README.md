# leaflet-repository
Bootcamp exercise for proficiency in making maps with JavaScript and Leaflet.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1) Pick a dataset from the USGS GeoJSON webpage. (All earthquakes from the past day was chosen for this project)

2) Import and visualize the data as so:

- Create a map using Leaflet that plots all the earthquakes from the chosen dataset, based on their longitude and latitude
	> Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. (e.g., stronger earthquakes will have larger markers, and deeper earthquakes will appear darker in color.

- Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when the associated marker is clicked on.
